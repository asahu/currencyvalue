# currencyvalue
Get the current exchange rate for your currency

This code uses a free REST API end point to get the current exchange rate of the currency based on a selected Base Currency

Example:
  If you type base Currency as USD, it will give you the value of your currency with respect to USD $1.

This is a Lightning Component and can be added to the Lightning UI.
